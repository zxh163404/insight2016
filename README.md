I used python 3.5 for this coding challenge.
As I am not allowed to use my most familar language (matlab), I spent  3 days learning some basics of python. Then I spent one day just trying to import the data without error and another day developing and implementing the fraud detection algorithm. Due to time limit, I was unable to add more features like amount of money and information in messages for fraud detection. 

I really appreciate this opportunity for taking on the coding chanllenge.  This experience let me have a glimpse of what real world data would be and how powerful python is in processing big data. I would like to learn more about big data and data engineering in the future regardless of the result of this application.
